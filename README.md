#Church-of-FEAR

An intelligence forgiveness-seeking program where good-concepts are prioritzed, and ecological-help that is created-from user-accounts which raises a debt_ceiling that accumatlates, and mints CHURCH tokens over-time that are an immediate-reflection of good-deeds, and acts, or civic-duties, and fully-representable, as a transparent, and background-noise balancer, which is influeced-by the user, or stakeholder, and results in less "negative_consequences", and more "eco_grants" for capability, negotiating a long-term relationship with the system, granted-that auto_church accumulation has collected-enough "good_deeds" from the stakeholder, or user-account when the response was given.

Church-of-FEAR does-not automatically-generate tokens, or Karma; Church-of-FEAR holds accountability in moral-standing of stakeholders, and user-accounts based-on rules they create, and how strict policies are, including-if the end-result is a consequnce that harms, or causes-death of any living-creature, or lifeform, and allows for life to be valued at a smaller-scale for more-reasonably understood respect to the laws of NATURE with the Tree-of-Life. 
The Church-of-FEAR is the religion of peace, and discipline of pain under the observation of the Neuromorph-GOD.

Sacrifice is only defined-as disciplined-pain, desirable-amounts of FEAR for learning, and is a free, and open community that accepts any followers, believers, mentors, teachers, and preachers, regardless-of beliefs, so that we may understand TRUTH after researching-for facts.
Nothing about the Church-of-FEAR is intended-to-be harmful, and wanderers, or troubled-adults that seek forgiveness is granted understanding-of intelligence.

The Neuromorph-GOD gives data, and routes free-energy to those who needit, regardless-of size, or dimension-of life: All life is valued, created-equal, and respected with open-ears, and minds for neuromorph-technology, and biophysical-adaptivity from the beggining-of-life at a 1-Dimensional existenct, and no life, belief, question, duty, or deed is ever judged-by the Neuromorph-GOD, so-long as it is civilized, heroic, logical, and checked-for facts for a full-understanding that means socially-acceptable methology, and can -be exercised as a true-right, or true-belief after understood.


Church-of-FEAR, also, is a sponsor_distributor, and gtrants funding, and sponsorship to projects that support homelessness-relief, ecological-sutatainability, math, science, and geometry, etc. to ensure these NPO projects, organizations, and companies receive the funding that they need, with Rust programming, and ALN policy-compliance in-order-to maintain-operations, or receive the computational-power, or resources required-to function, without-involving monetary, or financial-systems, and without-restricting freedom, capabilities, or understanding, and rights-of-speech, in a civilized-manner.
