edition = "2021"
description = "A Rust implementation of the NeuroEcoIdentityManifest for neuromorphic rights and ecological accountability. Builds on CEIM mass-balance, NanoKarma operators, and safety polytopes, extending with RAF, bee-weighted polytopes, and Errority logging. Ensures inner domain inviolability while scaling outer agency via verifiable, physics-anchored responsibility."
