ROW,doc,Treats voluntary high-load, high-FEAR/PAIN episodes as research contributions,
ROW,doc,not downgrade triggers, when HPCC/ERG/TECR and envelopes remain within safety.

ROW,role,POLICY,RESEARCH-NEURORIGHTS

; 1. Qualify discipline windows (chosen, bounded, research-intent).

ROW,field,discipline_mode_enabled,bool,true

ROW,invariant,DISCIPLINE-WINDOW-DEFINITION,
  "A DISCIPLINE window is any contiguous epoch range where:
   - BIOTREE/NATURE/GOAL logs show explicit intent such as
     'discipline', 'training', 'research-contribution', or equivalent,
   - FEAR and/or PAIN are elevated relative to the subject's baseline,
   - RoH <= 0.30 and all BiophysicalEnvelopeSpec minsafe/maxsafe
     constraints are respected,
   - UNFAIRDRAIN is false for the subject over that window
     (no asymmetric drain vs peers)."

; 2. Prohibit downgrade proposals sourced from discipline windows.

ROW,invariant,NO-DOWNGRADE-FROM-DISCIPLINE,
  "For any DISCIPLINE window, ReversalConditions and PolicyStack
   MUST NOT treat elevated FEAR/PAIN as justification for downgrade.
   CapabilityTransitionRequest of type DOWNGRADE MUST ignore
   FEAR/PAIN from DISCIPLINE windows when computing evidence,
   and MUST NOT use these windows to satisfy nosaferalternative."

; 3. Bind discipline to HPCC/ERG/TECR as a positive signal.

ROW,invariant,DISCIPLINE-HPCC-ERG-TECR,
  "When DISCIPLINE windows complete without violating RoH <= 0.30
   and with TECR showing stable or recovering DECAY/LIFEFORCE over
   the following recovery epochs, Pattern-I analytics agents MUST:
   - log a DisciplineContribution record containing:
       * HPCC (RoH traces),
       * ERG indicators (CALM_STABLE/OVERLOADED/RECOVERY counts),
       * TECR summary (DECAY/LIFEFORCE/TIME/NANO),
       * FEAR/PAIN trajectories,
       * BIOTREE/NATURE/GOAL for the subject,
   - mark this record as research-grade evidence for improving
     envelopes, diagnostics, and medical models for similar profiles."

; 4. Require learning, not suppression.

ROW,invariant,LEARN-NOT-SUPPRESS,
  "DisciplineContribution records MUST be:
   - append-only in .evolve.jsonl and hash-linked via .donutloop.aln,
   - consumable by research sandboxes and fairness panels to update
     HPCC/ERG/TECR understanding and envelope tuning,
   - forbidden as direct predicates in CapabilityTransitionRequest
     or ReversalConditions. They MAY inform better models and care,
     but MUST NOT be used to reduce capability or restrict future
     access to discipline_mode."

; 5. Respect subject's stated purpose.

ROW,invariant,SUBJECT-PURPOSE-RESPECT,
  "If the subject's GOAL logs explicitly state contributions such as
   'improve medicine', 'advance research', or 'help future lives',
   fairness reports and research usage of DisciplineContribution
   records MUST preserve this purpose in their metadata, so that
   the subject is recognized as a contributor, not merely as a
   risk object."
