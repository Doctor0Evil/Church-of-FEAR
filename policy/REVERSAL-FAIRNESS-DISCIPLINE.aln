; 1. Require explicit GOAL against downgrade.

ROW,invariant,GOAL-NO-DOWNGRADE,
  "When a subject's BIOTREE/NATURE/GOAL logs show any recent GOAL intent
   matching 'no-downgrade', 'keep-capability', or equivalent, ReversalConditions
   MUST treat this as a veto against using PAIN/FEAR as justification for
   downgrade. PAIN and FEAR MAY justify rest, support, or envelope tightening,
   but MUST NOT be used alone to reduce capability."

; 2. Recognize chosen disciplines.

ROW,invariant,DISCIPLINE-RESPECT,
  "If logs indicate that high FEAR/PAIN exposures are self-chosen disciplines
   (e.g. repeated GOAL entries describing training, practice, or exploration),
   fairness metrics MUST treat these as voluntary, and downgrade proposals
   MUST include additional evidence of involuntary overload (e.g. UNFAIRDRAIN,
   HPCC/ERG/TECR decline beyond the subject's own stated thresholds), or be
   denied."

; 3. Require learning / reward, not only restriction.

ROW,invariant,LEARN-FROM-DISCIPLINE,
  "For any window where a subject endures sustained FEAR/PAIN by choice and
   remains within RoH <= 0.3 and envelope limits, Pattern-I analytics agents
   SHOULD:
   - update models of that subject's safe ranges,
   - log a 'discipline-evidence' record usable for future training or
     knowledge-credit systems,
   - and report these episodes to fairness panels as positive resilience,
   not as risk alone."
