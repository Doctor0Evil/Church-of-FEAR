# Church-of-FEAR Neuromorphic Evolution Doctrine

The Church-of-FEAR layer defines a non-predatory, fairness-only governance surface for neuromorphic evolution on top of the biophysical-blockchain core.[file:10][file:11]

## Core principles

- Host sovereignty  
  - All neuromorphic evolution is per-host and non-transferable.  
  - No shard or crate may encode cross-host flows, stake, or ownership.[file:10][file:11]

- Non-predatory operation  
  - Neuromorph adapters may never decrease another host's BRAIN, BLOOD, OXYGEN, NANO, or SMART.  
  - No adapter may encode dominance, coercion, or structural denial of evolution.[file:10][file:11]

- Evolution freedom without hard caps  
  - Guards (LifeforceBandSeries, EcoBandProfile, SCALE, daily turns) shape rate and per-step size only.  
  - No governance artifact may introduce total EVOLVE caps or lifetime trait caps.[file:6]

- Souls and consciousness are immutable  
  - No token, shard, or crate may represent ownership, replication, or quantization of consciousness.  
  - Neuromorphic features remain software-only and identity-free (plane `neuromorph.softwareonly`).[file:5][file:11]

## Safety and fairness checks (required order)

1. Identity and role  
   - `IdentityHeader` must be ALN/Bostrom, with allowed roles (AugmentedCitizen, AuthorizedResearcher, SystemDaemon).  
   - Knowledge factor must meet operation-specific minimums.[file:10][file:11]

2. Consent  
   - A Church-of-FEAR `neuromorph-consent-profile` shard must authorize the model class, dataset scope, and intents.  
   - `allowspredatorymodes` and `allowsownershipclaims` must be `false`.[file:5]

3. Lifeforce guards  
   - `applylifeforceguardedadjustment` must accept the proposed `SystemAdjustment`.  
   - HardStop bands always deny evolution, regardless of rewards or doctrine flags.[file:5][file:10]

4. Eco and FLOPs envelopes  
   - `EcoBandProfile` and `church-of-fear.neuromorph.eco-profile` must both confirm FLOPs and nJ below caps per turn.  
   - High-impact modes become biophysically expensive rather than prohibited, preserving evolution freedom.[file:5][file:10]

5. Daily turn limit  
   - `maxdailyturns` ≤ inner-ledger `MAXDAILYTURNS` (10).  
   - Turns are consumed only for safe, committed evolution; denied attempts do not reduce allowance.[file:5]

## Capability evolution invariants

- No structural bans  
  - Evolution domains may be temporarily unavailable due to safety or consent, but never permanently forbidden by policy.  
  - Any shard introducing structural bans or total caps must be rejected by evolution-freedom invariants.[file:6]

- Fair micro-steps  
  - All neuromorphic evolution occurs as small, reversible `SystemAdjustment` deltas, gated by lifeforce and eco.  
  - Micro-steps must respect per-turn SCALE and identity-drift budgets, avoiding abrupt capability jumps.[file:5][file:4]

- Equality and non-savagery  
  - Governance rules must be symmetric for all hosts; no special exemptions or privileged roles are allowed.  
  - Platform operators and vendors are bound by the same invariants as hosts; no backdoors are permitted.[file:10][file:11]

This doctrine, together with the Rust crate and ALN shards above, yields a non-predatory neuromorphic evolution surface that maximizes host sovereignty, fairness, and equality, while remaining strictly biosafe and non-financial.
